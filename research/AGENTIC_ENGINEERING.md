## 📚 DEFINITION

**Agentic Engineering** is the discipline of building AI systems that can reason, plan, and act autonomously to achieve complex goals, rather than just answering prompts.

### 🔄 The 2024 → 2026 Shift

| Dimension | 2024 (Generative AI) | 2026 (Agentic Engineering) |
|-----------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| **Human Role** | Human-in-the-loop (chat) | Human-on-the-loop (oversight) |
| **Architecture** | Single LLM answering questions | Multi-Agent Architecture |
| **Capabilities** | Prompt response | Long-term memory, tools, self-correction |
| **Model Role** | Copilot (helps you write) | Employee (does work for you) |

## 🏗️ MULTI-AGENT ARCHITECTURE

### The Manager → Researcher → Coder Pattern

```
Manager Agent (GLM-4.7)
├─ Researcher Agent (Kimi K2.5)
│  ├─ Searches databases
│  ├─ Retrieves context
│  └─ Summarizes findings
├─ Coder Agent (MiniMax M2.5)
│  ├─ Writes code
│  ├─ Tests implementations
│  └─ Validates outputs
└─ Orchestrator (Co-Processor)
   └─ Wisdom extraction, pattern analysis
```

## 🌿 SAKANA.AI - Biomimetic AI Leader

### Core Philosophy
"Nature-inspired Intelligence." Next leap in AI comes from mimicking biological evolution and swarm dynamics, not brute-force compute.

### Key Innovations

#### 1. Evolutionary Model Merge
- **Problem:** Training from scratch costs millions
- **Solution:** Take existing models (parents) and use evolutionary algorithms to "breed" them
- **Process:**
  1. Start with 2+ open-source parent models
  2. Use evolutionary algorithms to swap layers and weights
  3. Test thousands of "offspring"
  4. Select best performers
- **Result:** High-performance Japanese and math models with fraction of compute

#### 2. AI Scientist (Autonomous Research)
- **Released:** Late 2024
- **Capability:** Fully autonomous scientific research
  - Generate hypotheses
  - Write code
  - Run experiments
  - Write full papers
- **Autonomy:** Complete pipeline without human intervention
