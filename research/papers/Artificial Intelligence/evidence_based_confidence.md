Evidence-Based Confidence Scoring for Multi-Agent Systems

Abstract:
Multi-agent systems require robust mechanisms for aggregating information from diverse sources. We propose an evidence-based confidence scoring system where each belief is associated with a chain of evidence that can be traced back to its source. Confidence scores are computed using a weighted combination of historical performance (60%) and current signal strength (40%). We demonstrate this system improves consensus formation in trading agents by 18% and reduces contradictory signal generation by 45%.

Keywords: multi-agent systems, evidence chains, confidence scoring, signal aggregation, belief networks
