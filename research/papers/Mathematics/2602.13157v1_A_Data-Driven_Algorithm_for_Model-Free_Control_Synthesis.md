## Abstract
Presented is an algorithm to synthesize the optimal infinite-horizon LQR feedback controller for continuous-time systems. The algorithm does not require knowledge of the system dynamics but instead uses only a finite-length sampling of arbitrary input-output data. The algorithm is based on a constrained optimization problem that enforces a necessary condition on the dynamics of the optimal value function along any trajectory. In addition to calculating the standard LQR gain matrix, a feedforward gain can be found to implement a reference tracking controller. This paper presents a theoretical justification for the method and shows several examples, including a validation test on a real scale aircraft.
