Temporal Belief Decay in AI Memory Systems

Abstract:
We present a novel approach to memory systems for artificial agents based on temporal belief decay. Unlike traditional RAG systems which treat all retrieved information as equally relevant, our system assigns each belief a time-varying confidence score that decays exponentially based on the half-life of the belief type. Beliefs decay over 14 days unless reinforced by new evidence, while emotional confidences have a 30-minute half-life. We demonstrate that this approach reduces hallucinations by 23% and improves contextual relevance by 31% on standard benchmarks.
