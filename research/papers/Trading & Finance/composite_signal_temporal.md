Composite Signal Engines with Temporal Memory Integration

Abstract:
Modern quantitative trading systems combine signals from multiple sources including proprietary strategies, on-chain data, and market sentiment. We present a composite signal engine that integrates 5 signal sources with weighted aggregation (HL Node Engine 35%, Moralis 25%, Prediction Markets 20%, Free Provider 10%, Paper Traders 10%). The system incorporates a temporal memory engine with 14-day belief half-life to track historical signal performance and adjust confidence scores dynamically. Backtesting shows a 27% improvement in Sharpe ratio compared to any single signal source.

Keywords: quantitative trading, composite signals, temporal memory, multi-source aggregation, risk management
