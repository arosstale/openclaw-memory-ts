## Abstract
Equilibrium statistical ensembles commute with the Hamiltonian and thus carry no coherence in the energy eigenbasis. We develop a thermodynamic framework in which energy fluctuations can retain genuinely quantum-coherent contributions. We foliate state space into "minimum-variance leaves," defined by minimizing the average energy variance over all pure-state decompositions, with the minimum set by the quantum Fisher information. On each leaf we construct the least-biased state compatible with normalization and mean energy, defining a leaf-canonical ensemble. The Gibbs ensemble is recovered on the distinguished commuting leaf, while generic states are organized by their leaf label. This structure provides a natural setting to extend eigenstate thermalization beyond equilibrium via a "leaf typicality" hypothesis. According to that hypothesis, under unitary time evolution local observables depend only on the leaf and energy and, at all times, are reproduced by evolving a representative (pure) state drawn from the optimal ensemble.
